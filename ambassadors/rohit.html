                        <h3>"By having skills in programming, one’s opportunities are limitless..."</h3>

                        <h4 class="ambassador">Bio</h4>
                        <p>Rohit is a freshman at Harvard interested in Computer Science and Economics. Despite having no knowledge of programming before college, Rohit is determined to use the resources at his disposal to master this difficult yet beautiful skill. Hoping to enter the tech startup industry, Rohit ultimately wants to create an app himself and introduce it to the world. After college, Rohit hopes to accomplish two main goals:  design a computer science curriculum for Carteret High School—his high school—and have his parents retire from their blue-collar jobs.</p>

                        <h4 class="ambassador">Why I think coding is important</h4>
                        <p>"Having knowledge of coding allows one to tread in the technological wave that is hitting today’s generation. By having skills in programming, one’s opportunities are limitless, from being able to change the system of education in third world countries to simply becoming a more attractive candidate for a top-tier company. But beyond these perks, the knowledge of coding endows one with a new, more logical perspective that can extend to various outside fields, such as economics, mathematics, statistics, and even philosophy. For instance, an understanding of Booleans and 0s and 1s can assist in reading through primary sources for a philosophy course, ensuring that there can only be one correct interpretation rather than multiple ones. Therefore, the versatility of coding is what truly makes this skill so valuable and so crucial to learn in college."</p>

                        <h4 class="ambassador">Why I'm excited for iExperience</h4>
                        <p>"College was my first exposure to programming and I believe iExperience will allow me to continue to inch my way over the steep learning curve that accompanies learning this skill. With such motivation in mind, I am excited to code for eight to ten hours a day. My family has also never had the opportunity to go on a vacation due to financial considerations. So having the opportunity to go to Cape Town is an absolute blessing. With iExperience as my gateway into the technology industry, I am not only eager for this summer, but also want to promote this program to anyone else who is also interested in computer science."</p>
