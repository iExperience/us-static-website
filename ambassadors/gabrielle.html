                        <h4 class="ambassador">Bio</h4>
                        <p>Gabrielle Cheng or Gaby has spent majority of her childhood in Hong Kong while moving to the United States at the age of 15. She has a twin sister so part of daily surprises is meeting people and making friends unexpectedly. During her free time, she likes watching TED talks, volunteering, and playing piano. She also loves travelling. Recently, she has visited Zion National Park, Bryce National Park, and Antelope Canyon around Arizona in the United States and she hopes to visit more! Making positive changes, particularly towards international or social issues, is a value she deeply cares and strives for.</p>

                        <h4 class="ambassador">Why I think coding is important</h4>
                        <p>"Learning to code is particularly important in this technological era because it is the simplest and most direct way to communicate an idea to a mass audience. Whether by building apps or designing a product, coding provides an opportunity for students to convert their ideas to tangible products that interact with others. Particularly, college is the time for students to explore variety of knowledge as well as a milestone prior to other major academic or career plans. Therefore, students are able to execute their ideas freely with supports and resources provided by the university. Learning to code allows students the design, test, and build their ideas in hope to equip them with necessary skills and knowledge to understand the inventions of ideas as well as the power technology holds."</p>

                        <h4 class="ambassador">Why I'm excited for iExperience</h4>
                        <p>"I am excited for iExperience because I hope to meet other passionate college students who are not only enthusiastic about coding, but also making social impacts! I cannot wait to hear other studentsâ€™ ideas of their apps and collaborate with others to successfully implement our ideas. Cape Town has always been a destination where I want to visit because of the diverse and unique culture it holds."</p>
