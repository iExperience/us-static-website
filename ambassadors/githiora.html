                  <h3>"Learning to code during this time allows you not only to appreciate the relevance and power of this skill set, but also to build prototypes of ideas that you or your friends might have, launching you into the world of entrepreneurship at a ripe young age."</h3>

                  <h4 class="ambassador">Bio</h4>
                  <p>Githiora Thuku is a senior concentrating in applied math. Githiora grew up in Nairobi, Kenya, and studied at various international schools there. He completed his last two years of high school at the African Leadership Academy - a two-year boarding school in Johannesburg, South Africa, that aims to develop the next generation of African leaders - and graduated as a member of the school’s inaugural class. In characteristic Brown fashion, Githiora has participated in several different extra-curricular activities since matriculating in the fall of 2010, including the African Students Association, the Meiklejohn peer advising program, and Brown men’s club soccer. Githiora also has varied academic interests and will have taken at least one course in 10 different academic departments, ranging from philosophy to music and economics, by the time he graduates this May. In his past summers, Githiora has worked in engineering, math research/consulting, and investment banking/private equity. Githiora has tremendous respect for the entrepreneurial process and is very excited for iExperience!</p>

                  <h4 class="ambassador">Why I think coding is important</h4>
                  <p>"The college experience is truly a unique one. You are surrounded by like-minded, passionate, and enterprising individuals who want to make a difference in the world and have fun while doing it! Learning to code during this time allows you not only to appreciate the relevance and power of this skill set, but also to build prototypes of ideas that you or your friends might have, launching you into the world of entrepreneurship at a ripe young age."</p>

                  <h4 class="ambassador">Why I'm excited for iExperience</h4>
                  <p>"Notwithstanding that iExperience will have me coding for most of the day, which is exciting in itself, the program is much more than just that. It is an exercise in the entrepreneurial process taking place in Cape Town, one of the most beautiful cities in the world! I'm also excited to meet all the other participants in the program and I look forward to leveraging my time with them in Cape Town into meaningful, long-term relationships."</p>
