      				<h3>"When you learn to code, you learn to construct logical frameworks upon which almost any of life’s problems can be deconstructed, and that makes coding invaluable."</h3>

      				<h4 class="ambassador">Bio</h4>
      				<p>Francois had the good fortune of being born in Cape Town. Sadly, a cruel twist of fate (his family moved) resulted in him spending most of his formative years under a, distinctly humid, Natal sun. During a five-year stint in boarding school, Francois's interest in mathematics, science, and technology swelled (as did his appreciation for fitted sheets and instant shoe shine). Francois is currently pursuing his passion for analytical creativity as a Mechanical Engineering major.</p>

      				<h4 class="ambassador">Why I think coding is important</h4>
      				<p>"The importance of learning to code becomes apparent the moment you look beyond coding as merely another skill in your professional toolbox. When you learn to code, you learn to construct logical frameworks upon which almost any of life’s problems can be deconstructed, and that makes coding invaluable."</p>

      				<h4 class="ambassador">Why I'm excited for iExperience</h4>
      				<p>"As both an exciting adventure and vitally important educational experience, this program is shaping up to be one of the most interesting ventures I have yet had the privilege to be a part of."</p>
