      				<h3>"I'm excited for iExperience because it is giving people the opportunity to combine all three activities: travel, study, and work."</h3>
      				
      				<h4 class="ambassador">Bio</h4>
      				<p>Francesca lives in San Francisco and attends Stanford University. Both her parents were born and raised in South Africa and she has spend her whole life visiting and spending summers in South Africa. Cesca plays squash at Stanford and is studying IT and Media Communications.</p>

      				<h4 class="ambassador">Why I think coding is important</h4>
      				<p>"Understanding some coding is so important for everyone because computer science is becoming more and more prevalent each day. Living in Silicon Valley, I see the rapid growth of coding relevance in almost all work places. Having an understanding of computers and how they work gives an individual an advantage in the competitive work world we live in, making them much more attractive for any job application. There is so much pressure on the summer break in the US - people need to get jobs, but they also want to travel, yet feel they need to continue their studies."</p>

      				<h4 class="ambassador">Why I'm excited for iExperience</h4>
      				<p>"I'm excited for iExperience because it is giving people the opportunity to combine all three activities: travel, study, and work. This summer should be amazing and I hope everyone else is excited too!"</p>
