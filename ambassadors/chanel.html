                        <h3>"Learning how to code in college provides you with endless opportunity and places you well ahead of the game."</h3>

                        <h4 class="ambassador">Bio</h4>
                        <p>Chanel is a student at Trinity College originally from Cape Town, South Africa - obviously the most beautiful city in the world. She loves hanging out with friends, being active and getting involved in all aspects of campus and community life. Chanel hopes to be a sports broadcaster at a major broadcasting firm one day.</p>

                        <h4 class="ambassador">Why I think coding is important</h4>
                        <p>"The world is changing so rapidly and with that comes new and improved versions of every kind of technology we can possibly think of. Learning how to code in college provides you with endless opportunity and places you well ahead of the game. It is a skill and a tool that many young and innovative people are looking to have."</p>

                        <h4 class="ambassador">Why I'm excited for iExperience</h4>
                        <p>"What excites me the most about iExperience is that it is an opportunity for students to broaden their skill sets and gain experience in the world of technology.  Who wouldn't want to to learn how to code with the backdrop of table mountain and the clear blue waters of Clifton beach. It really is the new big thing that produces nothing but excellence."</p>
