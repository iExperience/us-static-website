                        <h3>"Code creates the building blocks of today’s world."</h3>

                        <h4 class="ambassador">Bio</h4>
                        <p>Sarah is a sophomore at Harvard studying Computer Science in the Mind/Brain/Behavior program. She is currently from the small town of Manhattan, Montana, though thanks to her USMC father, she also calls Georgia, Spain, Illinois, North Carolina, and Japan her home. All that moving around has instilled a true love of travel. At Harvard, she has been involved in cheerleading, Strong Women Strong Girls, Women in Computer Science, and she is the Director of Sisterhood in Delta Gamma.  She especially loves anything to do with artificial intelligence and is interested in studying the intersection of technology and the mind.</p>

                        <h4 class="ambassador">Why I think coding is important</h4>
                        <p>"Coding is the language of creativity. Today, the internet and technology is one of the best ways to communicate with people. Code creates the building blocks of today’s world. Knowing how to code gives you the tools you need to turn your visions into something that can truly make a difference."</p>

                        <h4 class="ambassador">Why I'm excited for iExperience</h4>
                        <p>"I am so excited for iExperience because I love to learn about new parts of the world, and I’ve never been to South Africa before! My hope is that iExperience will turn my abstract coding knowledge into something tangible. To be able to begin with an idea, develop it from start to finish, and have it mean something is what I truly would love to accomplish in iExperience. I want a more hands-on experience, and I want to learn to create something with real-world relevance. An internship at a tech start-up would be a glimpse into the field that I have not yet experienced, and that would hopefully inspire me even more."</p>
