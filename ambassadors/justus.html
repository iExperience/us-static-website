                        <h4 class="ambassador">Bio</h4>
                        <p>Justus studied medicine and healthcare economics in Munich. He is living his childhood dream, specializing in surgery. Parallel to university he travelled extensively, studying how medicine is practiced in different cultures and economies. His family ties to Cape Town make sure he spends a lot of time in this beautiful city and on the beaches around it.</p>

                        <h4 class="ambassador">Why I think coding is important</h4>
                        <p>"Software is everywhere, running everything. Whatever job you do, a general understanding of how software is created will always be beneficial. That was the very serious part. Now honestly, coding is plain fun. Doing fun things is quite high up on my list."</p>

                        <h4 class="ambassador">Why I'm excited for iExperience</h4>
                        <p>"I love to challenge myself, to learn new skills and to immerse in new worlds. iExperience offers me all this in very little time. And on top you get to spend time in Cape Town. It is quite a 'benefits everywhere' situation."</p>
