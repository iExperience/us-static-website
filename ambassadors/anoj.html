      				<h3>"Being able to code not only teaches you how to think, it also gives you an unparalleled platform to apply all types of knowledge to solve the problems of today."</h3>
      				
      				<h4 class="ambassador">Bio</h4>
      				<p>Anoj Ilanges is currently a sophomore at Yale University originally from Oceanside, New York. He is studying Molecular, Cellular and Development Biology with a concentration in Neurobiology and focuses much of his time on research at the medical school. He is also recruitment coordinator for the admissions office and is apart of Yale’s iGEM team. In his free time, he likes to go on long runs, hang out with friends, and sleep.</p>

      				<h4 class="ambassador">Why I think coding is important</h4>
      				<p>"College is a time to both have fun and to learn how to think. Regardless of what subjects are your focuses, acquiring knowledge is straightforward and easy; learning how to apply it is the part that takes time and effort. Being able to code not only teaches you how to think, it also gives you an unparalleled platform to apply all types of knowledge to solve the problems of today. Also, with every field quickly integrating technology into their practice, without an understanding of coding and programming, you will be missing a vital skill set."</p>

      				<h4 class="ambassador">Why I'm excited for iExperience</h4>
      				<p>"iExperience is twice as good as any other intensive coding program or abroad experience out there because it will not only be a summer of learning how to code, it will be summer of cultural immersion in the amazing city of Cape Town, South Africa. From the pristine beaches, the scenic countryside, to the bustling city center, I can’t wait to check out all the attractions Cape Town has to offer. To top it all off, the program brings together some of the best students in a collaborative environment. I am looking forward to all the great ideas that will be thrown around and realized!"</p>
