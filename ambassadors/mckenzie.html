                              <p>McKenzie is a senior at Stanford University, majoring in Human Biology. She fell in love with Cape Town in 2010 when she first visited the Mother City for a global health conference, and has made it a point to return and work in Cape Town ever since. Recently, she spent six months in Cape Town studying abroad through Stanford and carrying out mobile health research with the MetroEMS. McKenzie loves to talk about anything and everything Cape Town, whether its about the best places to grab a coffee and code, or to go kiteboarding and surfing, she's sure to have answers!</p>

                              <h4 class="ambassador">Why I think coding is important</h4>
                              <p>"I recognize that coding is an important life and work skill in the digital era. Coding is integral at almost every level of daily life, from websites to data management to health. It is an incredibly powerful knowledge base that has already transformed the way we interact with the world around us, and the earlier you learn it, the earlier you can help make meaningful change."</p>

                              <h4 class="ambassador">Why I'm excited for iExperience</h4>
                              <p>"I'm extremely excited for iExperience! Not only is it a way to learn how to code from world-class developers, iExperience is empowering some of the smartest individuals both from the States and from Cape Town. Together they'll tackle coding challenges in the unique environment of Cape Town, having the opportunity to apply their skills to both the for-profit and non-profit sectors. And, iExperience allows you to do all of this while getting to know Cape Town, the most amazing city on Earth!"</p>
