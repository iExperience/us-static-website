      				<h3>"I believe that being able to code gives you the skills to immediately start realizing and concretizing your own ideas without having to depend on others to do that for you."</h3>

      				<h4 class="ambassador">Bio</h4>
      				<p>Harrison Miller is a sophomore at Yale University and a man with a vision of leadership. This past year he co-established a fraternity at Yale, founded the Yale Archery Club & Team, co-founded an educational technology start-up, and acted as an undergraduate Spanish translator at Yale Law School. A lover of computer graphics and metaphysics, he is a prospective cognitive science major but has done organic chemistry research in chiral phosphoric acid catalysis, for which his work will be published. Outside of academics, his favorite hobbies are Zen meditation, Olympic-style archery, and public speaking. He will be doing public mental health work in South Africa funded by the Saybrook College Babcock Travel Research Fellowship and hopes that iExperience can endow him with the skills to be an even more versatile thinker and inventor.</p>

      				<h4 class="ambassador">Why I think coding is important</h4>
      				<p>"I think that learning to code in college is so important because it helps you cultivate a powerful sense of independence. I have always believed that ideas have a shelf life; you have to act quickly to germinate and expand a new idea within an optimal time frame. I believe that being able to code gives you the skills to immediately start realizing and concretizing your own ideas without having to depend on others to do that for you. The creator who generates incredible ideas AND has the skillset and tools to implement them...well, he has the true power in today’s world."</p>

      				<h4 class="ambassador">Why I'm excited for iExperience</h4>
      				<p>"What excites me most about iExperience is that the program is just a rich mosaic of so many attractive things. You get Cape Town, new and vibrant people, breathtaking adventures, technical skills, real-world experience, intellectual exploration, and more! The entire program has been thoroughly engineered so that your experience in Cape Town is as thrilling and well-rounded as possible! I love that. I truly believe that iExperience has something to offer anyone who loves to create, travel, or inspire. Oh, and who doesn’t like those African penguins on the beach?"</p>
