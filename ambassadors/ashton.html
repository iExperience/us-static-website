      				<h3>"Learning to code enables people to realize their visions and solve a plethora of problems with little overhead."</h3>

      				<h4 class="ambassador">Bio</h4>
      				<p>Ashton is a Sophomore at Yale and an Electrical Engineering and Economics double major. He is interested in the intersection of engineering and entrepreneurship. Ashton has always been a proponent of learning how to code thinks iExperience helps provide the background required to realize a tech vision. Ashton also write for the Yale Daily News and is working on building Yale’s first Mars Rover for the University Rover Challenge in the Spring.</p>

      				<h4 class="ambassador">Why I think coding is important</h4>
      				<p>"Coding is one of the very few skills that you can use to take an abstract thought and create a working model of that idea in a short period of time without much cost or equipment. Learning to code enables people to realize their visions and solve a plethora of problems with little overhead. You can improve the quality of life and connect to more people almost instantly thanks to the universal nature of software."</p>

      				<h4 class="ambassador">Why I'm excited for iExperience</h4>
      				<p>"I am excited about iExperience because it will have two big impacts in my eyes: first, it will open up students from top universities to opportunities they would not have had without coding experience; second, it will show intelligent people a new and exciting part of the world with a budding startup culture. There’s nothing like being immersed in a startup atmosphere, especially when the entire industry is growing in a new market."</p>
