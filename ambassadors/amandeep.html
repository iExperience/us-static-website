                        <h3>"I have noticed that nothing excites me more than an adventure into the unknown. iExperience would be a summer long adventure for me."</h3>

                        <h4 class="ambassador">Bio</h4>
                        <p>Amandeep Saini is a freshman at Princeton University. Having initially entered college as a math major and with a fear of computers, his mindset drastically changed upon taking his first programming course, where he discovered the beauty of coding. Now, he is majoring in Computer Science, and hopes to be a part of a tech startup after college. Amandeep is also a member of the Princeton Bhangra team, a Punjabi folk-dancing group, which competes in both national and international competitions. Never having been to South Africa before, Amandeep is beyond excited for what awaits him this summer.</p>

                        <h4 class="ambassador">Why I think coding is important</h4>
                        <p>"Computers open the world to communication, information, and education. They are bringing advancement to every corner of the world, and access to technology is rapidly expanding. As a result, it has become easier to reach out and have an impact on distant communities. And so, the ability to code, in essence, is the ability to bring change."</p>

                        <h4 class="ambassador">Why I'm excited for iExperience</h4>
                        <p>"I have noticed that nothing excites me more than an adventure into the unknown. iExperience would be a summer long adventure for me. New people, foreign land, and a chance to conquer the frontier of web development all provide me an opportunity to venture into territory that I have never encountered before, whether physical or mental. With that, Iâ€™m sure that there will never be a dull moment in my days spent in the beautiful city of Cape Town."</p>
