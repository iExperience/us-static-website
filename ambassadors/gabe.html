                  <h4 class="ambassador">Bio</h4>
                  <p>Gabe Corso is currently a student at Dartmouth College. Before moving up to the New England area, he lived a tropical life in-between southwest Florida and Oahu, Hawaii. Gabe is working towards a major in Computer Science with a focus on Software Development and a minor in International Relations. At Dartmouth, Gabe is helping to create a full-time community residence that focuses on designing innovative technological solutions for commercial and private use. His strong belief in the benefits of open source development and the power of cooperation have led him to structure his personal ventures in a similar fashion. Besides academics, Gabe is a passionate musician and humanist who values a good story and a great cup of coffee.</p>

                  <h4 class="ambassador">Why I think coding is important</h4>
                  <p>"Coding is important because it <i>liberates</i> you. Learning how to code a program not only teaches you how to logically structure and execute your thoughts, it goes a step further by allowing any person with an idea to become a Creator. We are living in a transforming world that is becoming increasingly connected on a global scale through the Internet and technology in general. The Internet is an open forum of communication that has simplified and enhanced the human life exponentially since its genesis. It removes externalities that could stop a genius idea from being actualized, like access to resources, and provides equal opportunity to everyone. In this way, coding and technology open countless doors for the passionate Creator, no matter who they are or where they come from."</p>

                  <h4 class="ambassador">Why I'm excited for iExperience</h4>
                  <p>"iExperience excites me because it embodies change and positive progress through cooperation. Aside from the opportunity to work and play in one of the world’s top tourist destinations, Cape Town, iExperience brings some of the most motivated and talented individuals to one place. On top of that, the program focuses on supporting and changing the social landscape in a developing area through the power of technology. iExperience is the product of a spectacular marriage between innovation, technology, and execution in a globalized 21st century."</p>
