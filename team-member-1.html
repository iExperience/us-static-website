					<p>Aaron grew up on a farm in the remote winelands of Stellenbosch. His first interaction with his a computer came as late as 14 years old. He’s always had a passion for building things. His first day in America was his first day of college at Yale University, where he studied Mechanical Engineering.</p>

					<p>After completing his degree, Aaron went to work on Wall Street for a couple of years. Realising that Cape Town was the best place on earth, he decided to go home and persue his dream of working in Tech. His first job was as the Product Manager at a tech startup - Prodigy Finance. He’s since decided that he wants to empower people with the same skills. This is how iExperience was born.</p>
